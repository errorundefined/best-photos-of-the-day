# Best Photos of the Day

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com) does not provide an official way to access its "Best Photos of the Day" galleries. Thus, we had to break the photo URLs free from the newspaper's website using the awesome library [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup) in a Heroku app written in Python 3.

## It's fun!

And may change heavily.
