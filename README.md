# Best Photos of the Day

The Guardian does not offer an offical way to access it's 'Best photographs of the day' galleries. Thus, we had to break the photo URLs free from the paper's website using the awesome library [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup) in an Heroku app written in Python 3.

## It's fun!

And may change heavily.
